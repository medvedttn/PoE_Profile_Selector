# PoE_Profile_Selector
PoE profile selector

Allow fast switching user configs and run PoE exe after(or without) custom config selection.
No needed to retype auth data and set-up GUI setting for every window, 
just select pre-saved your config for specific window and run PoE!<br>
<br>
Note that currently PoE allow only max 2 windows.
<br>
Typical usage:<br>
1) Run PoE, make&save settings for 1st profile<br>
2) Run profiler, type new profile name(need to be filesystem valid chars) into combobox, click "Create profile.."<br>
3) Run PoE, make&save setting for 2nd profile<br>
4) Run profiler, type new second profile name into combobox, click "Create profile.."<br>
<br>
2 profile created, now you can select profile name from combobox and run PoE (enter path for PoE exe)<br>
